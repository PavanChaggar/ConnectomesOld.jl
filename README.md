# Connectomes

Connectomes.jl is a package for handling and plotting brain connectomes obtained thorugh tractography. The initial aims of the project are to be able to read and write graphml files into a standardised format for connectomes and to display these using [Makie](http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/).

## To do before release:
- [ ] Read csv formats for matrices and parcellations and write as graphml with standard fields.
- [ ] Put connectome and parcellation brains in the same space.
- [ ] Documentation.
