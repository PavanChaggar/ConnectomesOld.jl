# Connectomes

Connectomes.jl is a package for handling and plotting brain connectomes obtained through tractography. The initial aims of the project are to be able to read and write graphml files into a standardised format for connectomes and to display these using [Makie](http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/).

# Reading and Writing 

Connectomes.jl can be used for reading and writing parcellations and structural connectomes. Common inputs are .csv, .graphml and .xml. The standard output of Connectomes.jl is .xml.
